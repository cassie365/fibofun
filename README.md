In the age before diffusion models, existed **procedural art**. Simple rules which dictated how the virtual brush should dance across the canvas. To ensure that this art is not lost to me, I embarked on a journey that started with one famous sequence.

**Fibonacci sequence**... **Hemachandra sequence**... Different names...

But the numbers weave a tale which belongs to _everyone_.
_For some reason._

Enchanted by this sequence of increasing numbers, I sought to use it as the DNA for an art project. I could have named it something profound, or poetic. Instead, I've given this project the foolish name of "FiboFun".

Because names don't matter.

## Approach

For more details about the approach taken to generate lovely patterns, refer to the README in the `src/fibonacci_string` package. (WIP)

## Requirements

This project was created using:
Python: 3.12
The built in python turtle module.

No other dependencies are needed, except for eyes or some some sort of alternative way to receive visual information.

> If you do encounter trouble with a missing turtle module, you may need to install it manually. Details to come.

## Getting Started

1) Cloning `git clone https://github.com/cassie365/fibofun`
2) Navigate to the project dir `cd fibofon`

## Usage

### Starting

Start the project using
`python main.py` or `python3 main.py`

The painting process should begin with more information in the console.

### Modifying the generation
You can review `src/fibonacci_string/example.py` to modify the generation strategy and see how things are being done.

### Locating the Output
Two new directories will be created within your project folder.

`gens` contains .txt files containing the plain text fibonacci string generated in `example.py`

`output` contains .eps files with your finished painting.

### Viewing Output

To view the generated .eps files, you may need an external program. Microsoft's photo viewer does not support this format.

You can find more information on your options on [fileinfo.com](https://fileinfo.com/extension/eps)
